sudo hostnamectl set-hostname NEW_HOSTNAME
For Older Linux distributions, which uses SysVinit in short init, can have their hostnames changed by simply editing the hostname file located in:

# vi /etc/hostname
You then have to add another record for the hostname in:

# vi /etc/hosts
For example:

127.0.0.1 TecMint
You then need to run:
/etc/init.d/hostname restart
On RHEL/CentOS based systems that use init, the hostname is changed by modifying:

# vi /etc/sysconfig/network
Here is a sample of that file:

/etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME="tecmint.com"
GATEWAY="192.168.0.1"
GATEWAYDEV="eth0"
FORWARD_IPV4="yes"
